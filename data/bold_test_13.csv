'testing' : 'test'\r }\r    \r \r   thanks in advance!  \r \r \r     code editor or ide name and version\r \r visual studio code v1.21.1\r \r     os name and version\r \r osx 10.13.4\r

6,"simplesmtp can corrupt messages, occasionally breaking links and email delivery","simplesmtp  is responsible for taking a  mailcomposer  object and sending the email message it represents to the server.  to achieve this, it needs to wrap lines that exceed 76 columns, and to make sure that lines that start with a  .  are escaped  since a  .  on a line of its own indicates end-of-message .\r \r it fails to do the second part correctly, causing the  .  to be swallowed, which  if you're unlucky  can mean several different failure modes, depending on the length and contents of the personal message you wrote:\r \r 1. messages can be truncated and users may receive message fragments. \r 2. messages can lose any number of  .  in the message, including the one in the link back to the grain, making links break.  for instance, i received a link to https://oasis.sandstormio/shared/..., which is missing the . between \ sandstorm\  and \ io\ .  sandstormio is not a valid tld.\r \r options appear to be:\r \r 1. upgrade to node 4 and use  smtp-connection , which is actively maintained.  this involves fixing the  node-capnp  crashes and the usual amount of cautious testing involved when doing major upgrades.\r 2. fork/patch simplesmtp now despite wanting to eventually do 1.\r 3. do nothing.\r \r @jparyani feel free to correct anything above!"
