52,reduce memory footprint,"fujitsu has kindly shared their memory footprint measurements at scale, and the pmix footprint is growing at an unacceptable rate. the primary reasons are two-fold:\r \r 1. the use of fixed-length keys and namespace values is consuming a lot of empty space.\r 1. presence of a pmix\\_proc\\_t struct, which in turn contains a fixed-length namespace array, in the pmix\\_value\\_t data union, thereby causing that oft-used struct to be quite large\r \r concern was raised over the use of these in the pmix\\_info\\_t structure, but that is a red-herring. pmix only stores pmix\\_kval\\_t objects - the pmix\\_info\\_t structure is only used for interfacing to the outside. thus, we can resolve the problem by:\r \r 1. changing the pmix\\_kval\\_t to use flexible sized key strings. to avoid multiple tiny malloc's, we will move the key entry to the end of the struct and pre-compute size using the known string length.\r 1. replacing the pmix\\_proc\\_t in the pmix\\_value\\_t struct with a pointer to that struct\r 1. replacing fixed namespace arrays with variable-length storage in all internal objects\r \r these steps will resolve the problem without impacting any of the rm's or applications that have implemented their integration. this is a good thing as that would have been highly disruptive.",0
